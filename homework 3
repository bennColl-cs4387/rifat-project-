# Short Evaluation on potential First-Fix

For my first open-source contribution, I began by searching for beginner-friendly repositories on GitHub, focusing on Python-based projects since I am most comfortable writing in Python. I also sought out libraries that I use frequently or are related to my areas of interest, as this would help me better understand the issues before trying to solve them.

I found the [awesome-for-beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) repository, which lists beginner-friendly codebases. After reviewing several options, I decided on two python libraries: [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) and [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). Both are Python libraries that I regularly work with—Matplotlib for data visualization and scikit-learn for machine learning.

### Languages:
Matplotlib is primarily written in Python, with some components in C and JavaScript. Scikit-learn is also written mainly in Python, but it leverages a mix of C.

### Contributor Information: 
Both the projects have documentation that provides instructions on how to set up the development environment, and also a well-documented Contributing Guide that explains how to open pull requests, review code, and ensure contributions pass continuous  checks. 

### Interesting Issues: 
For matplotlib, filtering the issues by "Good First Issue" revealed several opportunities related to plot formatting, grids, and data import. These issues look both manageable and directly related to the visualization tasks I’m familiar with, making them a good starting point.

For scikit-learn,  the "Good First Issue" revealed several issues related to model input parameters. Since I work with these algorithms regularly, solving an issue related to input validation is particularly interesting to me.

### Estimation:
I’m positive that I can solve a selected beginner-friendly issue from either Matplotlib or scikit-learn in approximately 3 weeks. Before starting, I’ll have to invest time in understanding the development and contribution processes for both libraries to ensure I’m am well aware about contribution guidelines.
