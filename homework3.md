# Contributing to python library

For my open source work, I am considering Pandas, and Matplotlib to contrbute on. Both of these are beginner friendly to fix issues. 
python is the most familiar programming language for me and so it will be feasible for me for understanding and solving the issues.
I searched for beginner's friendly python project and from Sinha, I learnt about the https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners repository where I found about Pandas and Matplotlib as beginner friendly codebase. As i worked using there two libraries in my data science class, I am interested to work on these libraries

### Languages:
Pandas is written in Cython, python and C. Most portion of Matplotlob written in python and some portions are written in javascript and C.

### Contributor Information: 
Both libraries have documentation that gives information and insights on how to set up the environment to fix issues, and also a properly instructed guideline that explains how to open pull requests, review code, and ensure contributions pass continuous  checks. 

### Appealing Issues: 
For matplotlib, it uses numpy library very heavily to develop its functions for visualization. It seems pretty interting to me as it should use heavy number theory to fix the issues.
In pandas library, it mostly uses cython and python. I want to fix issue in python to  make data manipulation more feasible.

### Estimation:
I am optimistic about fixing the issue in either one of these projects within 3 to 4 weeks.
